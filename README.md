# PerOrbVtheta
This software computes periodic orbits and its properties (period, maximin or not) of a piecewise continuous stroboscopic map of a particular system (leaky integrate-and-fire model with a dynamic threshold).

You will need GSL libraries installed.

How to compile: g++ -o program PerOrbVtheta.c rk78.c -lm -lgsl -lgslcblas

More details soon in a forthcoming paper.
